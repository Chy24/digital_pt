## Problem

People sign up to gyms to assist in reaching their fitness goals, which is usually to bodybuild, lose weight, or to keep in shape. 
However, after they join the gym, people can be overwhelmed with the equipment, struggle with knowing what exercises to do, knowing the frequency of the exercise, and how to track their progress based on their goals. 
Personal trainers can assist with this problem, however they can be costly. 

## Solution

Create a digital Ruby application that runs through the terminal, to safely guide users with no prior knowledge to reach their fitness goals. The application would act as a digital personal trainer that would: 
* Suggest exercises to the users based on capability, location and goals.
* Keep track of progress based on exercise type, duration, number of reps (if applicable), and kgs in weights (if applicable).
* Prompt users (via audio) to push themselves further in their exercises.
* Have the ability to visualize progress (i.e. in graphs).
* Take into account previous performance when suggesting exercises.
* Save its user money on having a physical personal trainer.
